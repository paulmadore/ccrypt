January 29, 2002: Release 1.2

 This release provides vastly improved encryption/decryption speed. By
 optimizing one critical inner loop, ccrypt now runs about 2-3 times
 faster than the previous release. The only other changes were some
 minor improvements to the autoconf scripts. No new features were
 added.

November 28, 2001: Release 1.1

 There are two major changes in this release: first, I have added an
 option --unixcrypt, which allows the decryption of files that have
 been encrypted with the old unix "crypt" utility. Since the cipher
 used by "crypt" is broken and no longer secure, it is recommended
 that all such files should be converted to the ccrypt format. The
 second change is that ccrypt is now configured using the
 automake/autoconf tools. This should make compilation and
 installation a lot more standard and portable. This release of ccrypt
 compiles under Linux, SunOS, MacOS X, FreeBSD, AIX, and CygWin with
 no problems, and it should be portable to other systems with no or
 few changes. I have also added some tests that can be invoked by
 "make check", which check that ccrypt is working properly.

October 30, 2001: Release 1.0

 This is the first public release of ccrypt. It fixes the file format
 and the basic user interface. All future releases of ccrypt will be
 backward compatible with this format, i.e., they will be able to
 decrypt files that were produced by earlier releases.
